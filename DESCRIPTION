Description: Due to the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and 
    induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), even being provided with 
	signaling molecules to steer intestinal cell fate, off-target cell 
	types could be generated in the human pluripotent stem cell derived 
	intestine organoids (HIOs). By calculating the Euclidean distance 
	between the organoid cells and the developing human multi-endodermal-
	organ cells on the space of similarity to each cluster of each sample 
	of the developing atlas and searching for the k-nearest neighbor cells 
	in the developing atlas for each organoid cell, this package provides
	quantitative estimates about intestinal cell fate specification of 
	the HIOs. For visualization, it provides the option to project the 
	organoid cells to the developing atlas. In addition to assessment of 
	fidelity, this package also supports epithelial stem cell maturity 
	estimation by multiple ways, including transcriptome-deconvolution-
	based and transcriptome similarity to adult or develping duodenal 
	stem cells.
